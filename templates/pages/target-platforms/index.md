# Target platforms

Ubuntu works on any distribution or target platform, from IoT devices to servers and desktops.

## Desktop

Whether you are a beginner or a skilled developer, we recommend you install and test your software on the stable version of Ubuntu Desktop.

[Download Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

For testers and early adopters, the daily desktop build version can be downloaded anytime.

With Ubuntu Make, you can easily install the latest stable version of the most popular IDEs, regardless of your language and technology of choice.

## Server

From the simplest servers to powerful hyperscale servers and the cloud, Ubuntu Server can scale to fit all your needs. Ubuntu runs on x86, ARM and Power architectures and comes with all the tools you need to manage at scale.

## IoT

Ubuntu is at the heart of many smart devices â€“ from edge computing and wearables to autonomous vehicles and drones.

For fast iterations on your software and hardware stack, we recommend you install Ubuntu Server on your board.

When you are ready to deploy more advanced prototypes or a production environment, running  your snaps on Ubuntu Core is the best option. Snaps are confined for stricter security and provide automated software updates so your app is always fresh and never broken.
