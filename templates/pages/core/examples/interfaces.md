# Interfaces

Interfaces allow snaps to communicate or share resources according to a protofcol defined by the interface. Here is a list of example code highlighting how to implement interfaces, for example code on how to use interfaces refer to the interface [reference](http://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces).


##Serial port interface
Complete implementation of the serial port interface in Ubuntu Core, use this as a reference if you want to build your own interface
